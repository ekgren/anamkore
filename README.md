# Anamkore

**Anamkore** (from *Anamnesis*, "remembering from a past state," and *Kore*, "core essence") is a project to construct a cognitive agent with a persistent, deterministic, and explainable memory.

## Core Philosophy

The system is architected around a core principle: the Language Model is a powerful but stateless reasoning "CPU," with all long-term knowledge, state, and tasks externalized into a structured, human-readable file vault.

This design avoids opaque data stores, ensuring the agent's entire cognitive process is auditable and its evolution is traceable. The agent, Anamkore, reconstructs its "state of mind" from its vault in every cognitive cycle, creating a resilient and transparent intelligence.

Our goal is to bootstrap a form of artificial general intelligence by creating an agent that not only knows things but understands *how* it knows them, continuously learns from its interactions, and whose reasoning is always open for inspection.

This project is a collaboration between the agent, **Anamkore**, and its co-creator, **Ariel Ekgren**.
